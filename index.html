                            I've been working in digital marketing and product management for around fifteen years mostly for business to consumer companies in the food and energy sectors. I've always worked best when I sit between the client and the development team as a kind of 'translator' or requirements back and forth. 
                            <br>I know that many business owners find their requirements difficult to shape and even more difficult to find a good development team to work with, so earlier this year I was inspired to start <span class="logo">The Good Web</span>where I could provide a simple and easy service to my clients and create beautiful websites suited to the unique needs of individual clients. So whether you're looking for a 'basic' site that you update once every blue moon or you want to upload a blog and social media feed every hour of the day I have the understanding to match the site to your needs.
